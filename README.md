# Enumerable Ruby methods

> This project is the recreation of some of the methods that are part of the Enumerable module. The project method specifications were created using RSpec.

RSpec tests are writen as close to regular english as possible, so all the tests are descriptive on their own and express what methods are being tested and what is expected of them.

## Methods recreated:

- .each
- .each_with_index
- .select
- .all?
- .any?
- .none?
- .count
- .map
- .inject

## Built With

- Ruby
- RSpec
- Rubocop

## Run Tests

1. Clone the repo / download it
2. Open the terminal and cd into the enumerables folder
3. Run the "rspec" command.
4. The output will be formatted to show each of the tests that pass or fail.
